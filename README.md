More than often visual inspection is ineffective to determine a forgery in an image, making it potentially perilous for all the illicit means of its application. To overcome this problem, we analyze the effectiveness of a deep convolutional neural network for the detection as well as localization of the area of manipulation in forged images, bearing forgeries of simple as well as complex nature. Further along, we interface the trained model with a web application for users to interact with the model in a simple and effective manner, and finally, we also develop a chatbot for further easing the process of interaction with the model and effectively tackling the problem of fake news forwards in popular internet messaging platforms such as WhatsApp.
